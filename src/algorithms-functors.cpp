	//There is another algorithm know as upper_bound which works in a similar way
	//but it aslo returns the position where the element needs to inserted, i.e. one past the 
	//similar element.

	//equal_range algorithm returns the count of element queried. It returns pair of iterators.

	//sorting and binary search algorithms take in a comparator,
	//that modify the behaviour of the algorithms. 

	//If we define a comparator we need to overload < and not <=. STL is coded that way.
	//X < X should always return false. And also not modify elements.


	//Other sorts are stable_sort, partial_sort

	//nth_element - order statistics. 

	//STL also provides set operations

	//some algorithms of stl are present in <numeric>

	//transform operations are also very useful if similar operation needs to be performed 
	//on all the elements.
